# Setup

In order to set up the code and get it running, you will have to provide your own Photon AppID in the PhotonServerSettings file by the following steps:

And of course, this is what I am talking about if this popped up for you when you opened your project, don't close it:

Visit the [Photon engine](https://www.photonengine.com) website:

And click `Sign In` on the top right corner:

Now either Sign in to your Photon account if you have one or you can just create an account and login:

Once Logged in to your account, click `Dashboard`:

In the dashboard, create a new app as shown:

In the Create new App section, Make sure the `Photon Type` is `PUN` and add any name to that app and add a description which is optional, so after you're ready, click the `CREATE` button:

Once you have been redirected to the Dashboard, find your App and copy the `App ID` shown. Make sure you don't leak the App ID to anyone, it is like a password to your application:

And finally, paste in the App ID you've just copied into the `PUN Wizard` setup screen and click `Setup Project` button to finally setup your project!
